## Introduction
This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning** model to predict consumer behavior using historical data. The objective is to empower businesses to anticipate consumer actions, enabling data-driven marketing and customer engagement strategies.

## Project Scope
The model aims to analyze past consumer data to predict actions, such as clicking on an advertisement. By implementing various machine learning algorithms, we provide businesses with predictive tools that enhance marketing strategies and optimize customer retention.

## Project Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Bagging Classifier.
- High accuracy in consumer behavior prediction.
- User-friendly graphical interface for uploading and analyzing data.
- Comprehensive model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## System Analysis
### Problem Definition
Businesses struggle with effectively analyzing vast consumer data to extract actionable insights. Traditional models are limited in handling complex behavior patterns, resulting in missed opportunities for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

### Proposed Solution
This project uses a **Bagging Classifier** to enhance the prediction accuracy and mitigate overfitting, providing a robust model for real-time consumer behavior prediction.

### Advantages
- **Increased accuracy** and reliability.
- **Scalable** solution adaptable to various data scales.
- **Reduced risk** of overfitting through ensemble learning.

## Architecture
The project follows these main stages:
1. **Data Importing**: Load and map data into a structured format.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data, including normalization and encoding.
3. **Training**: Train models using Bagging Classifier and compare with other algorithms.
4. **Prediction**: Test the model's performance on new data.
5. **Visualization**: Display results and model accuracy.
